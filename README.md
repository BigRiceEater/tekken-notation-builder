# Notation Visualizer

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Roadmap

* Add version indicator at the bottom of page
* Report back to user what syntax was wrong to be helpful
* Add example of possible notations
* Add visual builder mode where users can drag commands to the pallete to build the combo instead.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5600](http://localhost:5600) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
